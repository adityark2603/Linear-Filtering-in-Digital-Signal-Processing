# Linear-Filtering-in-Digital-Signal-Processing

Linear Filtering in Digital Signal Processing is a technique used to modify or extract information from signals. It involves putting an input signal x[n] using a filter h[n] to produce an output y[n], usually via convolution: 
                             
                                                                                         y[n] = x[n] * h[n] 


**Applications of Linear Filtering:**

1. *Noise reduction*
   
   (i) Low pass filter removes high frequency noise from audio signals
   (ii) Band stop filter removes interference

3. *Signal separation*
   
   (i) Used in FM radio receiver
   (ii) Medical Imaging (ECG analysis)

4. *Feature extraction in Data Processing*:
   
   (i) Voice recognition (filtering voice signals to identify speaker)
   (ii) Seismology (detecting earthquake signals)

5. *Image Processing*:
   
   (i) Face recognition
   (ii) Gaussian filters smooth images before feature detection
